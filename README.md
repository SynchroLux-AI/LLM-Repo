# LLM-Repo
<h2> Overview </h2>

This repository is dedicated to the development of $\\color{yellow}\text{Large Language Models (LLMs) specific to scientific domains}$ and aimed at advancing natural language processing capabilities. The project focuses on creating efficient, scalable, and ethically responsible LLMs for various applications, including text generation, question answering, and task automation.

<h2> Project Goals </h2>

The primary objectives of this project are:

<!--Model Development: Build LLMs from scratch or fine-tune existing models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation.-->
<b>1. Scientific-Domain-Specific LLMs</b>: Develop or fine-tune LLMs optimized for specific domains, ensuring high performance in tasks like text generation, question answering, or document analysis within those fields.<br /><br />
<b>2. Efficiency</b>: Optimize models for reduced computational requirements, enabling deployment on diverse hardware, including edge devices.
<!--Open Collaboration: Foster a community-driven approach by sharing code, datasets, and research findings (where applicable).-->

<h2> Planned Features </h2>

Custom Architecture: Design and implement novel LLM architectures tailored to specific use cases.

Training Pipeline: Develop a robust pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Fine-Tuning: Create scripts and tools for fine-tuning pre-trained models on domain-specific datasets.

Evaluation Metrics: Implement comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including accuracy, coherence, and robustness.

Deployment: Provide tools for deploying LLMs in production environments, such as APIs or containerized applications.

Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation for model usage, training procedures, and contribution guidelines.

<h2> Roadmap </h2>
<li>Phase 1: Research and Setup</li>

Conduct literature review on existing LLM architectures and training methodologies.

Set up the repository with initial scripts for data preprocessing and model prototyping.

<li>Phase 2: Model Development</li>

Implement baseline LLM architecture.

Experiment with training on publicly available datasets.

<li>Phase 3: Optimization and Fine-Tuning</li>

Optimize model performance and efficiency.

Fine-tune models for specific tasks (e.g., chatbots, summarization).

<li>Phase 4: Deployment and Community Engagement</li>

Release pre-trained models and deployment tools.

Encourage community contributions through issues and pull requests.
